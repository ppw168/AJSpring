1. Source code is in the GitHub repository: https://github.com/ppw168/AJSpring.git

2. Oracle Database script is inside "Database export 2015-12-14.sql" file.

3. Database connection parameters are in the "application.properties" file under "src/main/resources" directory. Username/password has been obscured for distribution.

4. Application context is set to "AJSpring" in the same "application.properties" file. It determines the web URL (http://******:8080/AJSpring/#/).

5. Application is set to output "war" file because it was intended to be tested under a standalone Tomcat server. Use "mvn clean" and then "mvn package" to build. The output  should be "AJSpring.war" under target directory.

6. Due to legal reasons, Oracle JDBC driver is not available in central Maven repository. Driver file will need to be manually import into local Maven repository:
mvn install:install-file -Dfile=ojdbc7.jar  -DgroupId=com.oracle -DartifactId=ojdbc7 -Dversion=12.1.0.1 -Dpackaging=jar

7. Once deployed to a web server, testing link is http://******:8080/AJSpring/#/
